abt_me = '''
			I remember myself struggling through the concepts of C++ back in first year of college until one day
			a senior of mine recommended me Python. From that day Python has became my major programming knowledge.

			I remember wasting whole weeks over various Python projects & concepts instead of attending classes. I have 
			tried to explore Python in all aspects, from using Asyncio to Keras.
			Working with open-source made me familiar with some best coding practices and scaling applications. Open-source has 
			been the biggest source of my knowledge so far, not just limited to tech.

			When not coding, I can be found dancing, watching sci-fi shows, listening to pop songs.
